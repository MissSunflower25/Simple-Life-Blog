            <img class="about-me-img" src="img/about-me.jpg" alt="Man laughing in a wheat field.">
            <p><span class="bold">I used to be a pack rat</span>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but
                the
                truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold
                a
                relationship.</p>
            <h2>How I turned things around</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</span>. I literally put
                90%
                of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do.
                And
                it worked.
            </p>
            <h2>Now I live the simple life</h2>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                more,
                and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around, <span class="bold">I felt like I had no choice but to start
                    sharing how I did
                    it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this
                site!</p>
